Given puppet (comments before closing brace):
  node pizzabox.example.com {
    include some::resource
    # This comment is very important

  node pizzabox.example.com {
    include some::resource
    # This comment is very important
  }

Given puppet (closing brace after comment that contains closing brace):
  class something {
    #}
      }

Do (full text indent with '='):

" XXX: This test doesn't do what we're expecting: it seems as though indentation

Given puppet (multi-line string):
  class something {
    $var="
  This text on new line
   should not move
  "
        this::defined_type { 'foo':
  content => $var,
  }
      }

Do (full text indent with '='):
  gg=G

Expect puppet (multi-line string does not move and line after resumes indentation):
  class something {
    $var="
  This text on new line
   should not move
  "
    this::defined_type { 'foo':
      content => $var,
